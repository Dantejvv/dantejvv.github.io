# Privacy Policy for DaisyDos

**Last Updated:** December 22, 2025
**Effective Date:** December 22, 2025

## Overview

DaisyDos is a privacy-first productivity application designed for iOS. Your data belongs to you, and we've built the app to keep it that way. All your information is stored locally on your device by default, and you have complete control over whether to enable cloud synchronization.

## Our Privacy Commitment

- **Local-First:** All data is stored on your device by default
- **No Servers:** We do not operate servers that store your data
- **No Third-Party SDKs:** DaisyDos contains no third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking code
- **Optional Sync:** iCloud sync is disabled by default and requires your explicit opt-in
- **No Data Sales:** Your data is never shared with or sold to third parties
- **Complete Control:** You can export or delete all your data at any time

## App Store Privacy Disclosure

When you download DaisyDos from the App Store, you'll see our privacy "nutrition label" which discloses:

| Category | What We Collect | Linked to You? | Used for Tracking? |
|----------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| User Content | Tasks, habits, notes, photos you create | Only if iCloud enabled | No |
| Identifiers | None collected by us | N/A | No |
| Usage Data | None | N/A | No |
| Diagnostics | None | N/A | No |

**Data Not Collected:** We do not collect location data, contacts, browsing history, search history, health data, financial data, or any sensitive information.

## What Data the App Stores Locally

### App Settings

## iCloud Sync (Optional)

### How It Works

DaisyDos uses Apple's CloudKit framework to optionally sync your data across your devices. This feature is:

- **Disabled by default** - You must explicitly enable it in Settings
- **Uses your personal iCloud account** - Data syncs to your private iCloud storage
- **Private to you** - Data is stored in your personal private database within the app's CloudKit container, accessible only through your Apple ID
- **Can be disabled anytime** - Turn off sync in Settings at any time

### What Gets Synced

When you enable iCloud sync, the following data is synchronized to your private iCloud storage:
- All tasks, habits, and tags
- Photo attachments
- Completion history and analytics data
- App settings and preferences

### What We Cannot Access

When you use iCloud sync:
- Your data is stored in **your personal iCloud account**, not on our servers
- We (the app developers) have **no access** to your iCloud data
- Only you can access this data through your Apple ID
- Apple's iCloud Privacy Policy governs how your iCloud data is handled

### Offline Mode

- DaisyDos works completely offline
- Changes made offline are queued and synced when you reconnect
- You can use the app with iCloud sync disabled indefinitely

## Photo Attachments

When you attach photos to tasks or habits:
- Photos are stored locally on your device
- If iCloud sync is enabled, photos sync to your personal iCloud storage
- Photos are never uploaded to our servers
- You control which photos to attach (the app requests limited photo access)

## Notifications

DaisyDos uses local notifications to remind you about tasks and habits:
- All notifications are generated **locally on your device**
- No data is sent to external servers for notifications
- You control notification permissions through iOS Settings
- Notification preferences are stored locally (and synced via iCloud if enabled)

## Permissions

DaisyDos may request the following iOS permissions:

| Permission | Purpose | Required? |
|------------|---------|-----------|
| Photo Library | Attach photos to tasks and habits | Only for attachments |
| Notifications | Remind you about tasks and habits | Only for reminders |
| iCloud | Sync data across your devices | Only if you enable sync |

You can manage these permissions in iOS Settings at any time.

## Data Retention

### Active Data

Tasks and habits remain on your device until you delete them. You can delete individual items or all data through the app.

### Logbook (Completion History)

DaisyDos uses automatic tiered retention for completed task history:
- **0-90 days:** Full task details retained
- **91-365 days:** Summarized completion records (TaskLogEntry)
- **365+ days:** Automatically deleted

You can manually delete logbook entries at any time.

### When You Delete Data

- Deleted items are removed from your device immediately
- If iCloud sync is enabled, deletions sync across your devices
- Deleted data cannot be recovered (unless you have a device backup)

## Data Export and Deletion

### Export Your Data

You can export all your data from Settings. This supports your rights under GDPR (data portability) and CCPA (right to know):
- Export includes tasks, habits, tags, and completion history
- Data is exported in a standard format
- Exported files remain on your device until you delete them

### Delete All Data

You can delete all your data from Settings:
- Removes all tasks, habits, tags, and history
- Cannot be undone (unless you have a device backup)
- If iCloud sync is enabled, deletion syncs across your devices

## Third-Party Code and Services

### What We Use

DaisyDos is built exclusively with Apple's native frameworks:
- **SwiftUI** - User interface
- **SwiftData** - Local data storage
- **CloudKit** - Optional iCloud sync (only if you enable it)
- **PhotosUI** - Photo attachment picker (only accesses photos you select)
- **UserNotifications** - Local reminder notifications

### What We Do NOT Use

DaisyDos contains **no third-party code** for:
- Analytics or crash reporting
- Advertising or ad networks
- Social media integrations
- User tracking or profiling
- Data brokers or processors

This means your data never leaves Apple's ecosystem.

## Children's Privacy

DaisyDos does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. The app:
- Does not require account creation
- Stores all data locally by default
- Contains no advertising or in-app purchases targeting children

Parents should supervise their children's use of the app.

## Data Security

- All data stored locally on your device is protected by iOS's built-in security features
- If you use device encryption (iOS default), your DaisyDos data is encrypted at rest
- iCloud sync uses Apple's CloudKit encryption (data encrypted in transit and at rest)
- We do not transmit your data over the internet except through Apple's iCloud service (if enabled)

## Your Privacy Rights

### California Residents (CCPA)

You have the right to:
- **Know** what personal information is collected (see "What Data the App Stores Locally")
- **Delete** your personal information (available in Settings)
- **Opt-out** of data sales (we never sell your data)

### European Residents (GDPR)

You have the right to:

- **Erase** your data (delete options in Settings)
- **Data portability** (export feature)

- **Consent:** You choose to use the app and enable features like iCloud sync
- **Legitimate Interest:** Storing data locally to provide app functionality
