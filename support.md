## Frequently Asked Questions

### Where is my data stored?
All your data is stored locally on your device by default. iCloud sync is optional and disabled by default.

### How do I export my data?
Go to **Settings → Import/Export → Export Data** to export all your tasks, habits, and tags.

### How do I delete all my data?
Go to **Settings → Data Management → Delete All Data**. This cannot be undone.

### How do I enable iCloud sync?
Go to **Settings → iCloud Sync** and toggle it on. Your data will sync across all devices signed into the same Apple ID.

### Why aren't my notifications working?
1. Check that notifications are enabled: **Settings → Notifications**
2. Check iOS Settings: **Settings → DaisyDos → Notifications**
3. Make sure Do Not Disturb is off

### How do streaks work?
Streaks count consecutive days you complete a habit. If you miss a day, the streak resets. Use "Skip" to preserve your streak when needed.
